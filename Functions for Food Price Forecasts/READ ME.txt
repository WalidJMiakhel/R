# Food Price Analysis in Rwanda

## Overview
Welcome to the Food Price Analysis project! In this notebook, we delve into the fascinating realm of food prices in Rwanda. The primary objective is to understand the dynamics of food costs over time, leveraging data from the United Nations Humanitarian Data Exchange Global Food Price Database. As agriculture plays a significant role in Rwanda's economy, with over 30% contributing to the GDP and more than 60% to export earnings (as per the CIA World Factbook), examining food prices is crucial for comprehending the economic well-being of many Rwandans.
